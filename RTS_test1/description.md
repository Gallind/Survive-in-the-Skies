Survive in the Skies – Game Design Overview
1. Game Description
Survive in the Skies is a real-time strategy (RTS) game set on floating islands suspended in the sky. Players start with a base center and a hero and must gather food from neighboring islands, defend against waves of enemies, and meet survival quotas to ensure the prosperity of their people. The game blends classic RTS mechanics with modern visuals and creative fantasy environments.
2. Visual Style & Setting
The game's world is a series of lush or mechanized floating islands, resembling environments from games like Warcraft 3 or League of Legends but with unique aesthetics inspired by skyborne cities and steampunk machinery. Elements include stone-based town halls, floating grass platforms, mechanical enemy fortresses, bridges between islands, and hero units in stylized armor. A steampunk variant features a mobile machine-island with smokestacks, gears, and airships.
3. Game Mechanics
The game incorporates core RTS systems along with unique features tailored to its floating world setting:
3.1 Unit Control
Players control individual units and heroes using standard RTS-style commands (right-click to move, attack, gather, etc.). Heroes and units can be selected in groups and issued commands in real-time. (in the demo, the player can control only the hero)
3.2 Map System
The demo features a single handcrafted map made of multiple floating islands connected by bridges. Islands include the home base, resource zones, and enemy territory.
3.3 Enemy Waves
Enemy units spawn in waves, attacking the player base from specific directions. Some enemies remain static on outer islands, requiring players to mount expeditions.
3.4 Combat Mechanics
Standard RTS combat includes melee and ranged units, with health, damage, and attack speed stats. Units auto-attack when enemies are nearby.
3.5 Hero Abilities
Hero units and some advanced soldiers have unique abilities (e.g., fireball, stun, dash), cast using hotkeys (QWER). (in the demo only the hero will have 1 or 2 special abilities)
3.6 Buildings
Players can construct several building types: Base Center, Barracks (unit production), Houses (population limit), and Defense Towers (automatic ranged attacks). 
(in the demo the player will not be able to construct new buildings, but will begin with several buildings constructed)
3.7 Quota System
Players must gather a fixed amount of food in a set time to avoid failure. Resources are collected by specialized units sent to farms, animals, or forests on surrounding islands.
(the demo will feature only one type of food)
4. UX/UI Design
The game includes a clean, stylized UI with: resource bars (food, gold, time), health bars over units, ability hotbars, unit selection indicators, and mini-maps. The interface is designed to feel intuitive while preserving the fantasy aesthetic.
5. 3D Assets & Animation
Models include: hero character, soldiers, goblin enemies, floating island tiles, buildings, towers, and basic environmental props. Each unit features simple attack, walk, and idle animations. Visual effects include fireballs, explosions, and tower fire.
5.1 3D Models list (demo)
- Player hero
- 1 or 2 types of enemies 
- Town center
- Barracks
- 1 type of friendly unit
- Food creates
- Terrain models (obstacles, floating islands, paths, bridges exc.)


6. Demo Objectives
The goal of the 2-week demo is to deliver a single playable map showcasing:
- Full unit control
- Working enemy waves and combat
- Hero abilities
- Resource gathering and quota system
- Core building mechanics
- A complete game loop with win/lose conditions
